# A RecyclerView that is powered by Realm

### Latest 0.9.25 is built with Realm 2.2.1.

A powerful ```Recyclerview``` wrapper for working with ```Realm``` as your datastore. It supports the following features out of the box:

* Custom adapter that automatically refreshes the list when the realm changes and animates the new items in.
* Empty state
* Pull-to-refresh (backed by SwipeRefreshLayout)
* Infinite scrolling (callback for more data fetching)
* Section headers (backed by SuperSLiM)

##How To Include It:

```
    allprojects {
        repositories {
            // ...
            maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        }
    }
```

```
	dependencies {
	        compile 'com.github.thorbenprimke:realm-recyclerview:0.9.25'
	}
```

## How To Get Started:

The ```RealmRecyclerView``` has a few attributes that can be set in XML in order to customize its look and feel and most importanlty which layoutType is used. In addition, it relies on an extended ```RecyclerView.Adapter``` called ```RealmBasedRecyclerViewAdapter``` to provide support for animation and headers.

##RealmRecyclerView

The snippet below shows how to include the ```RealmRecyclerView``` in your  layout file.

```
    <co.moonmonkeylabs.realmrecyclerview.RealmRecyclerView
        android:id="@+id/realm_recycler_view"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:rrvIsRefreshable="true"
        app:rrvEmptyLayoutId="@layout/empty_view"
        app:rrvLayoutType="LinearLayout"
        />
```

Important to note here is that the ```app:rrvLayoutType``` attribute has to be set. It determines which ```LayoutManager``` will be used. The options are:

* ```LinearLayout```
* ```Grid```
* ```LinearLayoutWithHeaders```

All these will yield vertical linear or grid layouts.

###Other Attributes:

```rrvIsRefreshable```: Adds the pull-to-refresh feature to the ```recyclerView```. In order to receive the refresh events, a listner has to be set via ```setOnRefreshListener``` and ```setRefreshing``` is used to control either turn the refersh animation on/off.

```rrvEmptyLayoutId```: A custom empty state view can be provided via this attribute. Whenever the list has no item, the empty state is shown. 

```rrvGridLayoutSpanCount```: This attribute has to be set with an integer greater than zero when the ```rrvLayoutType``` is set to ```Grid``` unless ```rrvGridLayoutItemWidth``` is set.

 ```rrvGridLayoutItemWidth```: This attribute has to be set with a size value that represents the width of a grid column when the ```rrvLayoutType``` is set to ```Grid``` unless ```rrvGridLayoutSpanCount``` is set.

```rrvSwipeToDelete```: This attribute is only supported with ```rrvLayoutType``` of ```LinearLayout```. If set to true, swiping a row to delete is enabled. The row is deleted from the ```Realm``` directly.

##RealmBasedRecyclerViewAdapter: 

The heart of the ```RealmRecyclerView```'s functionality comes from this custom ```RecyclerView.Adapter```. It includes support for insertion/deletion animation whenever the ```Realm``` changes. It also inculde the logic to generate the headers for the list's contents if it's of type ```LinearLayoutWithHeaders```. 

* ```automaticUpdate```: If automaticUpdate is set, the ```RealmResults``` are automatially updated and the list is refershed with new results.

* ```animateResults```: If animateResults is set together with automaticUpdate, the automatic updates are animated. This is limited to a single deletion or insertion. If it's more than one item, it will simply refresh the list. The animation leverages the resuls primary key column in order as a unique identifier for each row. Therefore your ```Realm```'s schema needs to include a primary key column of type ```Integer``` or ```String```.

* ```addSectionHeaders```: When the ```rrvLayoutType``` is ```LinearLayoutWithHeaders```, addSectionHeaders needs be set in order for the adapter to generate the headers. The ```headerColumnName``` needs to be set as well in order to look up the header column programmatically your ```Realm```'s schema. *Note: There is currently no support for customizing the header and it is always inline|sticky.*
